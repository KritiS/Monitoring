  <h1>Monitoring Comparison</h1>
  <p>This report presents a comparative analysis of open-source monitoring tools for centrally managing Red Hat OpenShift, SUSE Rancher, and Broadcom Supervisor in an MSP context. Prometheus + Grafana, Zabbix, and VictoriaMetrics were shortlisted based on their platform compatibility, scalability, multi-tenancy, and open-source nature. Prometheus + Grafana, integrated with Thanos, is the recommended solution due to its cloud-native architecture, extensibility, and strong community support.</p>
